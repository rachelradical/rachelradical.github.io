# Anomaly Storyteller AI

## About the Anomaly Storyteller AI

The Anomaly Storyteller AI generates sample barcode scan data, analyzes it for anomalies, and then uses OpenAI's API to explain the anomalies by cross-referencing them with contextual data.

### Features:

* **Dataset Generator:** Generates sample barcode scan data, injects it with anomalies, and assigns contextual data.
* **Anomaly Detection Notebook:** Identifies unusual patterns in datasets and provides visualizations of detected anomalies.
* **AI-Powered Explanation:** Uses OpenAI to generate human-readable explanations and flag anomalies likely caused by fraud.

### How It Works:

The system first generates synthetic barcode scan data and introduces anomalies. The anomaly detection notebook processes the data, highlighting inconsistencies, and the AI provides context-aware explanations for the anomalies.
