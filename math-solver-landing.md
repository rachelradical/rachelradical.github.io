# Math Solver

## About the Math Solver

The Math Solver is a Python-based tool that helps analyze mathematical functions through symbolic computation and visualization.

### Features:

* **Gradient Descent Optimizer:** Uses iterative optimization to find function minima.
* **Math Solver:** Computes derivatives and integrals using symbolic algebra.
* **Visualization:** Generates function plots, derivative curves, and integral shading.

### How It Works:

Users can input a mathematical function and select whether to compute its derivative, integral, or perform optimization. The tool then visualizes the results and provides insights.
