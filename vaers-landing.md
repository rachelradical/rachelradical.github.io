# VAERS Covid-19 Data Analysis

## About the VAERS Covid-19 Data Analysis

This exploratory data analysis project delves into COVID-19 vaccine adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from 2021-2024. Leveraging data analytics techniques in Python, the analysis uncovered key insights, including geographic disparities in reporting, significant variations by vaccine lot, temporal patterns of adverse events, and notable gender-based differences in symptom frequency and severity. The project incorporates diverse visualizations such as heat maps, symptom co-occurrence analysis, demographic breakdowns, and natural language processing of patient-reported narratives to provide nuanced insights into vaccine safety monitoring.

### Features:

* **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly
* **Geospatial and Temporal Analysis:** Choropleth mapping, Time-series analysis, Resampling
* **Text Mining and NLP:** NLTK, WordCloud, Text Preprocessing and Tokenization
